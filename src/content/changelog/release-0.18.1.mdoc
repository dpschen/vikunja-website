This is a quick patch release fixing bugs with the user data export, the kanban board and saving repeating tasks attributes.
There are releases for the api, frontend and desktop parts of Vikunja.

As usual, you can find the full changelogs in the respective [frontend](https://kolaente.dev/vikunja/frontend/releases/tag/v0.18.1) and [api](https://kolaente.dev/vikunja/api/releases/tag/v0.18.1) repos.

To get the upgrade, simply replace the binary or frontend files or pull the latest docker images.
You can also check out the docs [for the api](https://vikunja.io/docs/install-backend/#updating) or [frontend](https://vikunja.io/docs/install-frontend/#updating) updating process.
