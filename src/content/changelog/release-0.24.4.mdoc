  Vikunja 0.24.4 update: Improved task management, bug fixes, and enhanced user
  experience. Discover key improvements for smoother productivity.
---

I'm excited to announce the release of Vikunja 0.24.4, the latest patch update focused on improving stability, fixing
bugs, and enhancing the overall user experience. This release addresses several key issues and introduces minor
improvements to make your task management smoother and more efficient.

While this update doesn't introduce major new features, it addresses several key issues that users have
reported, making your day-to-day task management more smooth and reliable:

- **Task Management Improvements**
    - Task comments are now paginated. Previously, if there were more than 50 comments on a task they would not be
      shown. This but has existed since almost 5 years and nobody ever noticed!
    - The task delete modal has been improved for mobile users, ensuring a better experience on smaller screens.
    - The close button does not show up anymore when tasks are not opened via a modal. It did not do anything, this
      resolves confusion about the button.
    - The task delete modal has been refined for mobile users, ensuring better usability on smaller screens.

- **Attachment Handling**: I've reverted a recent change in attachment handling to resolve unexpected behavior.

- **Filter Functionality**: For users with PostgreSQL databases, Vikunja now uses PostgreSQL's json search functionality
  to look for filters with dates. A fix introduced in the last release caused this problem.

- **File Management**: The file system now correctly uses absolute paths when specified.

- **Checkbox Rendering**: Previously, the checkboxes used in various places would not work in some older browsers,
  notably Firefox ESR. This is now fixed.

- **iOS Reminders App Compatibility**: A partial fix to allow list tasks to be displayed in the iOS Reminders app and
  Thunderbird. Thanks to [@jd for contributing this fix](https://kolaente.dev/vikunja/vikunja/pulls/2717)!

As usual, you can find the full changelogs in
the [code repo](https://kolaente.dev/vikunja/vikunja/src/branch/main/CHANGELOG.md#0244---2024-09-29).

To get the upgrade, simply replace the Vikunja binary or pull the latest docker image.
