# Desktop Packages

Vikunja is available as an electron-based desktop application for Linux and Windows.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release for your platform from [the download page](https://dl.vikunja.io/desktop/).
  * For Windows, choose the file with the `.exe` or `.msi` file ending
  * For a Linux-based operating system, choose a file with an ending for your operating system - we have builds for Alpine, AppImage, Arch Linux, Debian-based systems, FreeBSD, Fedora and Snap.
2. Run the downloaded package in the same way you would normally install a package for your OS.

## Flatpack

Vikunja Desktop can be installed via the [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.vikunja.Vikunja).

To install it, run the following command:

```
flatpak install flathub io.vikunja.Vikunja
```
